# R Website Builder

I use these scripts to automate generating content for static websites. The basic idea is to keep content in markdown format and then use these scripts to build the website.

Today, I'm revamping the structure and usage of this code but the general idea is to use templates for the structure of the HTML page. Dynamic content is substituted into the HTML page at key points using tags.

# R-Blog-Builder

A collection of R scripts that I am using to build the HTML pages for my blog.  It is nowhere near where I want to be and a work in progress, but I want to track my code here anyway.

So far all I have is the templates for the HTML files, the "staged files" that make up my website now and a start with an R script that will be adapted to automate the construction of the website.

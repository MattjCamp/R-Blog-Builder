# How to Add Content to a Blog Post 

Add content to **Website/Content/blog/blog-post/content.md** using markdown syntax.
The program will look at this file and convert what you have into
HTML and then publish this to your staged website.

## Topic Images

To get an image to automatically show up in your blog post
you must add an *images* directory to the folder where you
put your content. Add the image to the **images** folder and
then rename the image to be exactly the same as the blog post
content directory.

For instance, if your blog post directory name was *quick-smoothies*
then and you wanted an image to appear you would simple copy an image
file to your images directory and then rename the image file
to **quick-smoothies**.

>**NOTE** remember to remove the file extension.

# More Code Please

	I work on a computer that has many, many apps and frameworks and plug-ins that pump and bang
	and grind all night and day. It is a miracle that I can email or Tweat or talk on Skype or 
	that my clients will visit me here. There is so much code. Every few minutes my monitor blacks 
	out or the PC fan starts spinning like a meat grinder. There are too many background processes
	running.

	The Open Source people say that you choose all these things, choose the apps and frameworks 
	and plug-ins, me and all the programmers. Well, maybe this is true, maybe we can't live 
	without all this God Damn Code.
	
	Maybe I need the code to write, make love and eat. I'm going to hang a sign out my 
	cube that says "More Code Please", or "Thank You For Writing Code!"

	Maybe we are the kind of people who need to have what we don't want just to get along, to do 
	the basic things. Myself, I could not sleep last night and I could not put down the laptop 
	either. I tried to stop all the background threads from running, writing batch files and 
	scripts at 11PM in the Starbucks across the street.  But, the processes wouldn't end and 
	the fan was screaming and the battery was getting hot and the whole world was praying for 
	silence and it was up to me to close the program and I couldn't get it to shut down. I was 
	just making more code.

	I get a notification that my toilet paper has shipped. "Like!" I click at the ninja kitten
	vs cowboy puppy dance battle.  The barristas lined up at the counter, watching me
	with my text editor and latte at the table.  I turn away and put earbuds in but I can't 
	stand those things for more than a few minutes. Finally I jam down the off button until the 
	shutdown screen appears.

	It is the same every night. I love it. I need it. "Without you I could not live! I would 
	not have blogged this poem!,"  I yell, the monitor hanging, frozen.
	
This is sort of a tribute to Steven Jesse Bernstein, a Seattle area poet who passed away in 1991.  Bernstein
wrote this great poem, *More Noise Please*, that was put to music and released on an album my cousin pointed me
to in the nineties.  It's really good, you can see a recoding on YouTube here:

What I did with *More Code Please* was to try and match the cadence and irony of the Bernstein's poem while making the content about writing code.

**Why?**

Well, I was starting a new job in New York which gave me about a two hour commute between the train and subway so I had a lot of time on my hands.  *More Noise Please* came on my iPhone during a morning commute (I haven't heard the song for 10+ years).  I became obsessed with writing my own version and this was it.

There is something about the rhythm of this poem when put to music that lends itself to putting your own ironic spin in.  I am imagine all kinds of people with a *More XXXXX Please* poem.

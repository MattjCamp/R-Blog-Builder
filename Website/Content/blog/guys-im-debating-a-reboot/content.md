# Been Knocked Down Hard, But ...

<img id="leftimage" src="images/reset.jpg"" width=200pt>

I've been humbled over the past two years. Taken down a notch,
then two or three notches and then too many notches to remember.

**Let me explain**

Most of you don't know me from before, but in the years 2008 to around 2013
I was on top of my world.

# My Own Online Business

I had built an online business, based on high technology, that provided
an income equivalent to a mid-career software developer. While I had a full
time income, work was flexible. I could work 80 hours a week, 20 hours 
or zero hours a week.

Work never interfered with travel plans. If something needed attention
I could pop open my laptop and take care of business no matter where
I was.

After my daughter was born, I was around to help out and experience
firsthand all the big moments. Work, if you could even call what I did
work, was more like an adventure and a fantastic hobby that happened
to support me.

In short, I had the lifestyle that you may have heard about from 
the online gurus like [Tim Ferris](http://fourhourworkweek.com/blog/), 
[Pat Flynn](http://www.smartpassiveincome.com/) and the guys at
[Internet Business Mastery](http://www.internetbusinessmastery.com/blog/).

## But, The Dream Just Evaporated

In hindsight, the business didn't just evaporate overnight.
At the mid-point of that five year period, there came a point
where my *active income* (from things like consulting and teaching)
surpassed my *passive income* (apps, books and websites).

I had learned, second hand, from [Gary Vaynerchuk](https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/)
and his ilk that *hustle* could get you far. By year three, 
things were going better than ever but my *hustle* masked 
some big problems.

By 2013 and 2014, my passive income was gone and my active
income was solely dependent on a handful of unreliable
clients.

The technical skills that had made me one of the
few people in the world who could make iPhone apps in 2008
were severely out of date in 2014.

## I Had to Make a Decision

In 2013, I was faced with a hollowed out business and I had
to make a decision: recreate everything about the business
and essentially start from stratch or just let it go.

### I Let It Go

My business only worked when my apps, my consulting (teaching)
and my books all pulled their weight. To continue, I would need to 
rebuild all of that all at the same time to have any hope 
of maintaining an income.

<span style="color:red;">*Not only did I let it go, I burned it all down*</span>.
I took down my websites, pulled my iPhone apps, took down training programs,
changed my LinkedIn, canceled my Apple Developer account,
closed my bank accounts and dissolved the LLC.

Here's why

#### Rapid and Unrelenting Technology Changes

While I had written books and attended the WWDC conferences
throughout those years I hadn't been actively developing apps
since 2011. The tools have been getting major updates every
six months.

The app I slaved over in 2008 (the one that launched my company) 
could be built in a day or two with the latest technology.

Even the programming language had changed completely, we no 
longer used Objective-C to make apps. Apple invented a new 
programming language called Swift and this would quickly
become the gold standard in the summer of 2014.

That is, until 2015 when Apple released Swift 2...

#### Competition

My original app, Wine Pad, was one of the first 800
apps available in July 2008. While it wasn't available the
very first day of the new Apple App Store it made it in 
that first week.

I ended that year with 9 iPhone apps available, two
of which where featured on the App Store. Things were
going real well.

Today, Wine Pad would have to complete with over
**1.4 million** apps.

My first app cost 4.99 and people thought I wasn't 
charging enough. At that time software usually cost
about 50 bucks.

When I pulled my the successor app to Wine Pad, Tasting
Notes, customers were bitterly complaining about
Tasting Notes 2.99 price tag. They complained when
I temporarily reduced the price to .99...

It was the same story for the books and training
I was selling. These things always did way better than
my apps, but as iOS became popular and people realized that
learning iOS wouldn't get them rich overnight the demand
slowed for these products as well.

>*"In short, making iPhone apps was a wave and I was 
briefly on the crest of that wave. Then, it just washed
me away."*

# How to Sneak Back to the 9-5

Once I made my decision to let my business go
I had to find a job. When I started this task in the
early Spring of 2014 I thought that I would have my
pick of jobs. 

I honestly expected to be immediately snatched up
as an experienced iOS software developer or business
developer or something. *I wrote books on this
for fucksakes!*

It didn't happen. While I got interviews, I didn't
get offers. The already niche pool of iOS job
opportunities ran out.

<strong>*This was humilating*</strong>

After all - I had been touting myself as an 
expert just a few months ago. Now I couldn't get
a job anywhere near iOS and I had let my skills
stagnate. Things had caught up with me.

<strong>*I was starting to feel desperate*</strong>

At one point, I was passed over for a job that had a
salary of just half of what I was making in my online 
business. I reached out to someone who I thought was 
a trusted former manager who I did great work with,
but got snubbed. An exciting opportunity as a technical
trainer never got funded.

And so on and so on until I came close to hitting
rock bottom.

## When I Finally Landed

After about 9 months of this, I did end up with two strong
job offers: one at Apple as a writer (whelp)
and one at College Board. Both jobs were uniquely
matched to my skills but in dramatically 
different ways.

In the end, I had to pass on the opportunity
at Apple bacause I just couldn't afford to live
in Cupertino. This was it's own system shock -
the team at Apple was truly great and I was
devestated when I couldn't make it work.

The job I ultimately took combined my skills as a data 
analyst along with my experience with interactive
tools. It's a good job, good benefits and good
people.

It's basically a shinier version of the 9-5 job
I "escaped" 6 years ago. Working at this job has
come at the cost of a whole lot more notches that I
won't get into right now.

>Suffice it to say, going from
an indy Apple powered startup world to a Windows based
corporate non-profit has been a culture shock...

# Turns Out I Really Miss It

**This past year has been about survival**. I have fallen
very far over the the past two years and I am only just
now starting to rebuild. Life is slowly getting back
on track.

While I'm grateful for my job, I have the same problems here
that I did in my last job in 2007. I'm essentially a (now 
wannabe) tech entrepreneur in a job that's not quite right. 
I wanted to give you my story so you would have the context 
for the current decision that I'm considering.

## Answering the Call

I mean literally... An old friend from my past life's
mastermind group called me out of the blue to brainstorm
WordPress plugins. This was Tim from 
[Renegade Dad](http://www.renegadedad.net/).

So Tim is relentless <- working on various online
businesses since before I started and he has continued
since after I burned mine to the ground. He has done this
in spite of working 9-5 jobs, starting a family and dealing
with everything else that middle age dads deal with.

My conversation with Tim quickly moved from WordPress plugins
to online business.

>This conversation brought me right back to those not so old
days and really got me thinking. The seed was planted...

## Business As Hobby?

As much as I miss my business, there are things about
it that I absolutely *hated*. I can live without
the monthly hustle to earn enough to pay the bills
and **I can certainly live without the grueling 3-12
SEO Optimized bullshit blog posts I had to put out
every single week to stay relevent in the Googled
world.**

I could not stand the realities of marketing that naturally
push you into grayer and grayer territory. There are things
that I have done and said that I'm just not that proud of.

>The neccessities of online business took me away from
the core reason I went into online business in the 
first place.

This was business as usual, and that's not a place that
I want to go back to.

But, how about *business as hobby*?

### What I Loved

Having an online business did allow me certain
freedoms.

>But, it took away the biggest freedome of
all: the ability to create without economic constraints.

*I went into business to build apps.* In the end,
I am a builder and I am most happy when building. This
is why I like websites, software and writing.

Being in business made me a slave to myself. I could
only justify my limited time to build things that I 
thought would make money. **I couldn't afford to stop.**

In the beginning of my business, there was a six
month stretch where I just built apps. I was living
the Indy Mac Developer lifestyle and it was great.

It ended and things got to the point where my development
was outsourced because I couldn't justify taking myself away
from projects that made real money. I was funding other
people to do the work that I wanted to do by focusing on
things that I didn't really like to do like teaching and
consulting.

What I really loved was the geeky stuff: building iOS
apps and blogging.

# So, Here's What I Want To Do

I am thinking about rebuilding the app that was so 
close to the online identity that I used to have: Tasting
Notes. This app was the juiced up and optimized version
of my original app. Also, I want to continue to blog
and get plugged back into the Apple Developer community.

What I'm worried about is: 

- Will this be as fun as I think
it is considering I already have a pretty demanding day job?

- Will I follow through or end up just disappointing myself
in a few weeks?

- Am I just in denial about the reality of my life today?

- **This is my debate:** do I want to emotionally reinvest into this
thing?

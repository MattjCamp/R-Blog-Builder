# Data Science Certificate Program

<img id="leftimage" src="images/ds-venn.png" width=200pt>

Way back in the *year 2000* I left my first career
as a mental health counselor to work for an educational
research company.

In those days my job consisted of coding mainframe programs,
doing statistical analysis using specialized programming tools
like SAS and SPSS. I spent lots of time with Excel in those days.

As my career progressed I went to work on *interactive data
visualizations* using .NET and SQL Server databases. Lots of my
time was spent tidying up datasets so they could be used to 
generate statistics used in research and to construct tests.

I basically became a software engineer in practice, but my
company always struggled to give me and my colleagues an
appropriate job title. I've been called a statistical-assistant/associate/lead,
a statistical-programmer-analyst(senior/lead) and a data analyst.

Not really a programmer but not really a statistician either. My job title
when I went back to the field last year became *Research Statistician*. While
I always have been more familiar than most with statistics, I would hardly
consider myself a statistician.

It turns out that my field has received a huge upgrade in the since years 
since I left. We apparently now call ourselves *data scientists*. Pretty
interesting to see if the title sticks.

So, in the spirit of starting over and giving my own skills a serious
upgrade I have decided to take an online course on data science.

You can follow along if you like (the course is free). I plan on blogging
about this topic often as I go through this and I'm also taking notes and writing
code over on GitHub. Feel free to join the madness!

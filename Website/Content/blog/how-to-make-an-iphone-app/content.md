# How to Make an iPhone App

*How to Make an iPhone App*, this is what I typed into Google just now. When I 
sat down on Thursday to update Tasting Notes I had no idea where to start.

What was super funny is that my old blog came back in the search results.

**How ironic is that?**

This is the phrase that I had targeted with SEO to sell my training 
program of the same name years ago. Obviously, things have moved on
from that time. The other links didn't appear updated either.

## This Feels Overwhelming

Earlier this week, I naively thought that I would just sit 
down for an hour each morning and knock out the Core Data
portion of my app. LOL, that didn't even come close to 
happening.

**Deer in the Headlights**

That was me on Thursday. No idea where to start, completely 
paralyzed. Now I know how my students must have felt when I told
them to *just get started*.

Basically, I need to take a step back and go all the back
to the beginning. This project isn't going to be something
that I can just bang out in a day or two.

## Apple Developer Website

This is what I was looking for when I typed in that phrase. Of
course, the Apple website doesn't show up in the Google
results even though they have an amazing tutorial on
how to build an app that is pretty close to a Tasting
Notes.

Apple has written [Start Developing iOS Apps (Swift)]
(https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/index.html)
and it's fantastic. The first lesson is written in a Swift
Playground. You can interact with the code right in the lesson
itself. Amazing.

This is where I am going to have to start. At the very
beginning.

## The New Plan

Instead of pressuring myself to get Tasting Notes out the
door, I'm going to take some time to really learn Swift and the
updated Interface Builder tools.

Most of the techniques that I originally used in Tasting Notes
are now out of date. There are new tools in Xcode that really
changes how apps are made.

So, next week I will spend those mornings going over and
mastering each of those lessons from the Apple website.

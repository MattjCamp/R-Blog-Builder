<h1>How to Make an iPhone App</h1>

<p><img id="leftimage" src="images/costs-building-iphone-app.png"" width=200pt></p>

<p><em>How to Make an iPhone App</em>, this is what I typed into Google just now. When I 
sat down on Thursday to update Tasting Notes I had no idea where to start.</p>

<p>What was super funny is that my old blog came back in the search results.</p>

<p><strong>How ironic is that?</strong></p>

<p>This is the phrase that I had targeted with SEO to sell my training 
program of the same name years ago. Obviously, things have moved on
from that time. The other links didn&#39;t appear updated either.</p>

<h2>This Feels Overwhelming</h2>

<p>Earlier this week, I naively thought that I would just sit 
down for an hour each morning and knock out the Core Data
portion of my app. LOL, that didn&#39;t even come close to 
happening.</p>

<p><strong>Deer in the Headlights</strong></p>

<p>That was me on Thursday. No idea where to start, completely 
paralyzed. Now I know how my students must have felt when I told
them to <em>just get started</em>.</p>

<p>Basically, I need to take a step back and go all the back
to the beginning. This project isn&#39;t going to be something
that I can just bang out in a day or two.</p>

<h2>Apple Developer Website</h2>

<p>This is what I was looking for when I typed in that phrase. Of
course, the Apple website doesn&#39;t show up in the Google
results even though they have an amazing tutorial on
how to build an app that is pretty close to a Tasting
Notes.</p>

<p>Apple has written <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/index.html">Start Developing iOS Apps (Swift)</a>
and it&#39;s fantastic. The first lesson is written in a Swift
Playground. You can interact with the code right in the lesson
itself. Amazing.</p>

<p>This is where I am going to have to start. At the very
beginning.</p>

<h2>The New Plan</h2>

<p>Instead of pressuring myself to get Tasting Notes out the
door, I&#39;m going to take some time to really learn Swift and the
updated Interface Builder tools.</p>

<p>Most of the techniques that I originally used in Tasting Notes
are now out of date. There are new tools in Xcode that really
changes how apps are made.</p>

<p>So, next week I will spend those mornings going over and
mastering each of those lessons from the Apple website.</p>

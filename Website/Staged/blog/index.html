<p>Against the advice of almost everyone online business guru out there, I&#39;m building my own blogging engine.  <a href="why-i-am-building-my-own-blog-engine/">Here&#39;s why&hellip;</a></p>

<p><a href="Swift-Extensions/">Swift Extensions</a></p>

<p>You use extensions when you want to add methods and computed properties to a class, structure or enumeration that already exists.  This comes in handy when you want new behavior for a type, but only in a particular context.  Extensions will remind Objective-C programmers of categories.  <a href="Swift-Extensions/">MORE</a></p>

<p><a href="more-code-please/">More Code Please</a></p>

<p>I work on a computer that has many, many apps and frameworks and plug-ins that pump and bang
and grind all night and day. It is a miracle that I can email or Tweat or talk on Skype or 
that my clients will visit me here. There is so much code. Every few minutes my monitor blacks 
out or the PC fan starts spinning like a meat grinder. There are too many background processes
running.  <a href="more-code-please/">MORE</a></p>

<p>Way back on November 25th, 2008 I left my 9-5 job as a Statistical Programmer to see if I could make it as an indie software developer. </p>

<p>Over the past almost six years I&#39;ve had some incredible experiences and I&#39;ve done things I never thought was possible in a million years. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve published books, traveled all over the world to teach and ran an indie software business. But, like many things my business has reached the end of it&#39;s lifecycle.  <a href="end-of-an-indie/">MORE</a></p>

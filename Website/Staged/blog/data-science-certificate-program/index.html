<h1>Data Science Certificate Program</h1>

<p><img id="leftimage" src="images/ds-venn.png" width=200pt></p>

<p>Way back in the <em>year 2000</em> I left my first career
as a mental health counselor to work for an educational
research company.</p>

<p>In those days my job consisted of coding mainframe programs,
doing statistical analysis using specialized programming tools
like SAS and SPSS. I spent lots of time with Excel in those days.</p>

<p>As my career progressed I went to work on <em>interactive data
visualizations</em> using .NET and SQL Server databases. Lots of my
time was spent tidying up datasets so they could be used to 
generate statistics used in research and to construct tests.</p>

<p>I basically became a software engineer in practice, but my
company always struggled to give me and my colleagues an
appropriate job title. I&#39;ve been called a statistical-assistant/associate/lead,
a statistical-programmer-analyst(senior/lead) and a data analyst.</p>

<p>Not really a programmer but not really a statistician either. My job title
when I went back to the field last year became <em>Research Statistician</em>. While
I always have been more familiar than most with statistics, I would hardly
consider myself a statistician.</p>

<p>It turns out that my field has received a huge upgrade in the since years 
since I left. We apparently now call ourselves <em>data scientists</em>. Pretty
interesting to see if the title sticks.</p>

<p>So, in the spirit of starting over and giving my own skills a serious
upgrade I have decided to take an online course on data science.</p>

<p>You can follow along if you like (the course is free). I plan on blogging
about this topic often as I go through this and I&#39;m also taking notes and writing
code over on GitHub. Feel free to join the madness!</p>

<h1>Been Knocked Down Hard, But &hellip;</h1>

<p><img id="leftimage" src="images/reset.jpg"" width=200pt></p>

<p>I&#39;ve been humbled over the past two years. Taken down a notch,
then two or three notches and then too many notches to remember.</p>

<p><strong>Let me explain</strong></p>

<p>Most of you don&#39;t know me from before, but in the years 2008 to around 2013
I was on top of my world.</p>

<h1>My Own Online Business</h1>

<p>I had built an online business, based on high technology, that provided
an income equivalent to a mid-career software developer. While I had a full
time income, work was flexible. I could work 80 hours a week, 20 hours 
or zero hours a week.</p>

<p>Work never interfered with travel plans. If something needed attention
I could pop open my laptop and take care of business no matter where
I was.</p>

<p>After my daughter was born, I was around to help out and experience
firsthand all the big moments. Work, if you could even call what I did
work, was more like an adventure and a fantastic hobby that happened
to support me.</p>

<p>In short, I had the lifestyle that you may have heard about from 
the online gurus like <a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/blog/">Tim Ferris</a>, 
<a href="http://www.smartpassiveincome.com/">Pat Flynn</a> and the guys at
<a href="http://www.internetbusinessmastery.com/blog/">Internet Business Mastery</a>.</p>

<h2>But, The Dream Just Evaporated</h2>

<p>In hindsight, the business didn&#39;t just evaporate overnight.
At the mid-point of that five year period, there came a point
where my <em>active income</em> (from things like consulting and teaching)
surpassed my <em>passive income</em> (apps, books and websites).</p>

<p>I had learned, second hand, from <a href="https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/">Gary Vaynerchuk</a>
and his ilk that <em>hustle</em> could get you far. By year three, 
things were going better than ever but my <em>hustle</em> masked 
some big problems.</p>

<p>By 2013 and 2014, my passive income was gone and my active
income was solely dependent on a handful of unreliable
clients.</p>

<p>The technical skills that had made me one of the
few people in the world who could make iPhone apps in 2008
were severely out of date in 2014.</p>

<h2>I Had to Make a Decision</h2>

<p>In 2013, I was faced with a hollowed out business and I had
to make a decision: recreate everything about the business
and essentially start from stratch or just let it go.</p>

<h3>I Let It Go</h3>

<p>My business only worked when my apps, my consulting (teaching)
and my books all pulled their weight. To continue, I would need to 
rebuild all of that all at the same time to have any hope 
of maintaining an income.</p>

<p><span style="color:red;"><em>Not only did I let it go, I burned it all down</em></span>.
I took down my websites, pulled my iPhone apps, took down training programs,
changed my LinkedIn, canceled my Apple Developer account,
closed my bank accounts and dissolved the LLC.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s why</p>

<h4>Rapid and Unrelenting Technology Changes</h4>

<p>While I had written books and attended the WWDC conferences
throughout those years I hadn&#39;t been actively developing apps
since 2011. The tools have been getting major updates every
six months.</p>

<p>The app I slaved over in 2008 (the one that launched my company) 
could be built in a day or two with the latest technology.</p>

<p>Even the programming language had changed completely, we no 
longer used Objective-C to make apps. Apple invented a new 
programming language called Swift and this would quickly
become the gold standard in the summer of 2014.</p>

<p>That is, until 2015 when Apple released Swift 2&hellip;</p>

<h4>Competition</h4>

<p>My original app, Wine Pad, was one of the first 800
apps available in July 2008. While it wasn&#39;t available the
very first day of the new Apple App Store it made it in 
that first week.</p>

<p>I ended that year with 9 iPhone apps available, two
of which where featured on the App Store. Things were
going real well.</p>

<p>Today, Wine Pad would have to complete with over
<strong>1.4 million</strong> apps.</p>

<p>My first app cost 4.99 and people thought I wasn&#39;t 
charging enough. At that time software usually cost
about 50 bucks.</p>

<p>When I pulled my the successor app to Wine Pad, Tasting
Notes, customers were bitterly complaining about
Tasting Notes 2.99 price tag. They complained when
I temporarily reduced the price to .99&hellip;</p>

<p>It was the same story for the books and training
I was selling. These things always did way better than
my apps, but as iOS became popular and people realized that
learning iOS wouldn&#39;t get them rich overnight the demand
slowed for these products as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;In short, making iPhone apps was a wave and I was 
briefly on the crest of that wave. Then, it just washed
me away.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h1>How to Sneak Back to the 9-5</h1>

<p>Once I made my decision to let my business go
I had to find a job. When I started this task in the
early Spring of 2014 I thought that I would have my
pick of jobs. </p>

<p>I honestly expected to be immediately snatched up
as an experienced iOS software developer or business
developer or something. <em>I wrote books on this
for fucksakes!</em></p>

<p>It didn&#39;t happen. While I got interviews, I didn&#39;t
get offers. The already niche pool of iOS job
opportunities ran out.</p>

<p><strong><em>This was humilating</em></strong></p>

<p>After all - I had been touting myself as an 
expert just a few months ago. Now I couldn&#39;t get
a job anywhere near iOS and I had let my skills
stagnate. Things had caught up with me.</p>

<p><strong><em>I was starting to feel desperate</em></strong></p>

<p>At one point, I was passed over for a job that had a
salary of just half of what I was making in my online 
business. I reached out to someone who I thought was 
a trusted former manager who I did great work with,
but got snubbed. An exciting opportunity as a technical
trainer never got funded.</p>

<p>And so on and so on until I came close to hitting
rock bottom.</p>

<h2>When I Finally Landed</h2>

<p>After about 9 months of this, I did end up with two strong
job offers: one at Apple as a writer (whelp)
and one at College Board. Both jobs were uniquely
matched to my skills but in dramatically 
different ways.</p>

<p>In the end, I had to pass on the opportunity
at Apple bacause I just couldn&#39;t afford to live
in Cupertino. This was it&#39;s own system shock -
the team at Apple was truly great and I was
devestated when I couldn&#39;t make it work.</p>

<p>The job I ultimately took combined my skills as a data 
analyst along with my experience with interactive
tools. It&#39;s a good job, good benefits and good
people.</p>

<p>It&#39;s basically a shinier version of the 9-5 job
I &ldquo;escaped&rdquo; 6 years ago. Working at this job has
come at the cost of a whole lot more notches that I
won&#39;t get into right now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Suffice it to say, going from
an indy Apple powered startup world to a Windows based
corporate non-profit has been a culture shock&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Turns Out I Really Miss It</h1>

<p><strong>This past year has been about survival</strong>. I have fallen
very far over the the past two years and I am only just
now starting to rebuild. Life is slowly getting back
on track.</p>

<p>While I&#39;m grateful for my job, I have the same problems here
that I did in my last job in 2007. I&#39;m essentially a (now 
wannabe) tech entrepreneur in a job that&#39;s not quite right. 
I wanted to give you my story so you would have the context 
for the current decision that I&#39;m considering.</p>

<h2>Answering the Call</h2>

<p>I mean literally&hellip; An old friend from my past life&#39;s
mastermind group called me out of the blue to brainstorm
WordPress plugins. This was Tim from 
<a href="http://www.renegadedad.net/">Renegade Dad</a>.</p>

<p>So Tim is relentless &lt;- working on various online
businesses since before I started and he has continued
since after I burned mine to the ground. He has done this
in spite of working 9-5 jobs, starting a family and dealing
with everything else that middle age dads deal with.</p>

<p>My conversation with Tim quickly moved from WordPress plugins
to online business.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This conversation brought me right back to those not so old
days and really got me thinking. The seed was planted&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Business As Hobby?</h2>

<p>As much as I miss my business, there are things about
it that I absolutely <em>hated</em>. I can live without
the monthly hustle to earn enough to pay the bills
and <strong>I can certainly live without the grueling 3-12
SEO Optimized bullshit blog posts I had to put out
every single week to stay relevent in the Googled
world.</strong></p>

<p>I could not stand the realities of marketing that naturally
push you into grayer and grayer territory. There are things
that I have done and said that I&#39;m just not that proud of.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The neccessities of online business took me away from
the core reason I went into online business in the 
first place.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was business as usual, and that&#39;s not a place that
I want to go back to.</p>

<p>But, how about <em>business as hobby</em>?</p>

<h3>What I Loved</h3>

<p>Having an online business did allow me certain
freedoms.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But, it took away the biggest freedome of
all: the ability to create without economic constraints.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>I went into business to build apps.</em> In the end,
I am a builder and I am most happy when building. This
is why I like websites, software and writing.</p>

<p>Being in business made me a slave to myself. I could
only justify my limited time to build things that I 
thought would make money. <strong>I couldn&#39;t afford to stop.</strong></p>

<p>In the beginning of my business, there was a six
month stretch where I just built apps. I was living
the Indy Mac Developer lifestyle and it was great.</p>

<p>It ended and things got to the point where my development
was outsourced because I couldn&#39;t justify taking myself away
from projects that made real money. I was funding other
people to do the work that I wanted to do by focusing on
things that I didn&#39;t really like to do like teaching and
consulting.</p>

<p>What I really loved was the geeky stuff: building iOS
apps and blogging.</p>

<h1>So, Here&#39;s What I Want To Do</h1>

<p>I am thinking about rebuilding the app that was so 
close to the online identity that I used to have: Tasting
Notes. This app was the juiced up and optimized version
of my original app. Also, I want to continue to blog
and get plugged back into the Apple Developer community.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m worried about is: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Will this be as fun as I think
it is considering I already have a pretty demanding day job?</p></li>
<li><p>Will I follow through or end up just disappointing myself
in a few weeks?</p></li>
<li><p>Am I just in denial about the reality of my life today?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>This is my debate:</strong> do I want to emotionally reinvest into this
thing?</p></li>
</ul>

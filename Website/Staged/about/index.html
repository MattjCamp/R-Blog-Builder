<h1>Programmer &#9679; Writer &#9679; Data Visualizer</h1>

Matt Campbell is a geek-curious author, data analyst, programmer and sometimes entrepreneur.  He creates
interactive data visualizations that help researchers, the media and policy makers figure out how to push more kids towards college
success.

<h2>Technology Favs</h2>

As a self-taught programmer, Matt loves to tinker with technology.  He got the bug when he realized that learning Visual Basic
would dramatically transform his job as a research assistant into something much bigger.   Matt went on to build apps that automated
large and complicated data analysis and reporting using tools like SAS and C#.

<br/><br/>

Building an iPhone app business in 2008, pushed Matt closer to the role of software engineer.  Using a Mac to build mobile iOS applications was so inspiring that he wrote 5 books on programming.  This experience solidified Matt's love affair with programming languages.  Here is a greatest hits list of his technology favorites:

<ul><li>iOS</li>
	<li>.NET</li>
	<li>R</li>
	<li>VBA</li>
	<li>SQL</li>
	<li>SAS</li>
	<li>HTML</li>
	<li>XML</li>
	<li>CSS</li>
</ul>

<h2>Education</h2>

Matt earned an undergraduate degree in Quantitive Psychology from Penn State University.  This degree was psychology + computer science + math which makes an odd pairing by almost any measure.  But, this background turned out to be a good fit to the world of big data.

<br/><br/>

Matt also attained a Masters Degree in Information Systems while working at Education Testing Service.  This program provided a high-level overview on how to use information systems to drive business success.

<br/><br/>

While degrees are great and can open doors - much of what Matt has learned as been brought to him through various schools of hard knocks.  Learning programming on his own and then applying it to his job early on in his career was a big challenge that ultimately caused big disruptions for him professionally.

<br/><br/>

Building a technology business than was profitable enough to pay the bills for 6 years was a huge character building experience.  Losing all that taught Matt lessons too.  All of these lessons feed into his capacity to help the people he works with.

<h2>Professional Work</h2>

Matt's core competency is transforming ugly, messy and complicated data analysis processes into beautiful, automated information visualizations.  He will do whatever is necessary to weed out unhelpful and error prone manual processes to get digestible information into the right hands.

<br/><br/>

As an author, previous business owner, technical trainer and mobile app developer, Matt also finds himself engaging in other professional activities.

<h2>Personal Life</h2>

Technology is also an important part of Matt's personal life.  He loved tinkering with his Mac and playing PC games like Civilization, Skyrim and Supreme Commander.  Also, Matt is an avid blogger who writes about technical stuff for fun.

<br/><br/>

Some of Matt's other passions are cooking, traveling, hiking and writing.  He loves to spend time with his wife and five year old daughter.

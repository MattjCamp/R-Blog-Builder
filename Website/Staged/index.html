<h1>Matt Campbell</h1>

Hi, I'm Matt Campbell and this blog is where I write
about online business, iPhone apps and technology.

<h2>Online Business</h2>

<p>I love talking about online business, sometimes known
as Internet or lifestyle business. These are these business 
run by one or two people, typically from home or while traveling,
that exist entirely online.</p>

<p>From 2008 to 2014 I had my own online business called App Shop,
also known as Mobile App Mastery. I lived the 4 Hour Work Week.</p>

<p>In 2014 I lost everything and was devestated. I write about it all
here, including those gray and dark areas the gurus never mention.</p>

<h2>iPhone Apps</h2>

<p>In 2008, I was inspired by the App Store - I dropped
	everything to learn and eventually published iPhone
	apps. This was my gateway to online business.</p>
	
<p>Getting back into the iPhone app scene is a huge
	priority for me. I'll be writing about my experiences
	with Xcode and Swift as I do a major reboot of my iPhone
	app lineup.</p>
	
<h2>Data Science</h2>

<p>Data science is what I do professionally. The term data
science refers to the practice of using technology along
with analytical methods to gain insight.</p>

<p>I primarily do this using a programming language
named R along with data visualization tools like 
Tableau.</p>

## Overview

I'm using this as a shell to help test and look at the
new functions I'm building. This will be heavily revised.s

## Load Dependencies

Here is one place to load all the code that we will need.

```{r}

source('functions/locations.R', echo = FALSE)

dirs <- locations(getwd(),
                  parent.topic.dir = "blog",
                  topic.dir = "much-todo-about-something")

dirs

```
